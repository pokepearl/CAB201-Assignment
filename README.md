# CAB201 Assignment
Code for my CAB201 C# Assignment. This was the Space Race task, loosely modelled around the board game Snakes and Ladders.

## Building
1. Download the source code.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio (Developed with VS 2017)
3. Select whether to compile the Command Line or GUI version of the game.
4. Compile and run the output executable.

## Credits
Code developed by the Uni staff and myself.
